# Uncommon Julia Bug: Unexpected Type Handling

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Julia related to unexpected type handling within a conditional function. The initial implementation of `myfunction` lacks robust type checking and edge-case handling, leading to potential issues.

The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.jl` file provides a corrected version with improved type handling and better error management.

This example highlights the importance of thorough type checking and error handling when developing Julia code, even for seemingly simple functions.
